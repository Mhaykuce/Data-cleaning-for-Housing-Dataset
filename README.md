# Data-cleaning-for-Housing-Dataset
This repository showcases my data cleaning skills using SQL, where I worked on a hosing dataset transforming it into a clean and usable format.

Overview
The original dataset required extensive cleaning to ensure data accuracy and consistency. I performed the following  data  cleaning  tasks:
i.  Standardized  the date formats 
ii. Populated null values  with actual values where possible
iii. Created new columns to improve data organisation
iv.  Updated tables to  reflect corrected data
v.  Removed duplicate records to prevent data redundancy
vi. Standardized  text formats for consistency
