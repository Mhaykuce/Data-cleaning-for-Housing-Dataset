# Data-cleaning-for-Housing-Dataset
This repository showcases my data cleaning skills using SQL, where I worked on a housing dataset transforming it into a clean and usable format.

The original dataset required extensive cleaning to ensure data accuracy and consistency. I performed the following data cleaning  tasks ranging from; Standardizing the date formats, populating null values with actual values where possible, creation of new columns to improve data organisation, updating tables to reflect corrected data, removing duplicate records to prevent data redundancy and standardization of text formats for consistency.
